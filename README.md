# Face-Emotion-Detection-MAKATHON-PROJECT-
MAKATHON, ORGANISED  BY Maulana Abul Kalam Azad university of Technology ,West Bengal and Department of Information Technology, Govt. of West Bengal.

Motivation:
Our objective is to predict the expression of human face in real time as fast and as accurate as possible. We have tried to make one type of  model which can be used for prediction of expressions of both still images and real time video. However, in both the cases we have to provide image to the model.

Team:
It was a team project done in makathon (Hakathon of MAKAUT university and it was a 5 member team). Here, We have used convolutional neural network, part of deep learning.
